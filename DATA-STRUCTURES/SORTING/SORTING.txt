SORTING

A sorting algorithm will put items in a list into an order, such as alphabetical or numerical order. For example,
a list of customer names could be sorted into alphabetical order by surname, or a list of people could be put into
numerical order by age.Sorting a list of items can take a long time, especially if it is a large list. A computer
program can be created to do this, making sortinga list of data much easier.There are many types of sorting algorithms.
